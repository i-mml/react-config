##########     set data or remove data    ############
for set item in redux we should use our actions functions
like setUserInfo , this functions has a argument that is data

// redux/actions/user.actions.ts
const setUserInfo = (data) => {
    type: SET_USER_INFORMATION,
    payload: data
}

there is a type element in function , that is familar in user reducer
that means we should declare this type in reducer to do something...

// redux/reducers/user.ts
    case SET_USER_INFORMATION:
      return action.payload;

then we use the functon (setUserInfo) and dispath it with useDispatch hook

// pages/login.tsx
const dispatch = useDispatch()

dispatch(setUserInfo(data))

##########     get data    ############
there is an hook that is useSelector()
we pass the reducername and get the reducer state data

const userInformation = useSelector(state=> state?.userInformation)
